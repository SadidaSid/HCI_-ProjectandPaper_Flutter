# Index of Difficulty Measurement for Handedness in Human Computer Interaction

Objective: The aim was to experiment by developing a cross- platform mobile App using Flutter to gather data points based on user response to screen objects, on an equal number of self-identified right and left-handed users. This data is studied and analyzed to enhance the designing of the apps to improve user experience irrespective of whether they are right handed or left handed. The data collected can also be used for keystroke biometrics authorization. 
The methodology includes the following key components:
1)	First experiment screen captures the time to reach and click a target point, and the width(of press 
         elipse and release elipse formed by fingers) in each of the four quadrants on the display.
2)	Second experiment measures accuracy via timing features and touchscreen features with 
        dropdown menu.
3)	Experiment three checks for screen visibility. Timing and response speed are addressed by 
        designing mirror image screens asking subject to click on the specified object from each image.

All these experiments make use of fits and steering law to predict users response time based on the positioning of screen elements and their size and also the movement of the hand across the screen.
